==========================
=== Step-by-step Timeline ===
==========================

1. After 4 seconds â†’ `concurrentStart` is called.
2. Logs:
   ==CONCURRENT START with await==
   starting slow promise
   starting fast promise

3. After 1 second:
   fast promise is done  <-- The fast promise finishes first

4. After 2 seconds:
   slow promise is done  <-- The slow promise finishes second

5. `await slow` resolves, and logs:
   slow

6. `await fast` resolves immediately (already done), and logs:
   fast

=====================
=== Final Output ===
=====================

==CONCURRENT START with await==
starting slow promise
starting fast promise
fast promise is done
slow promise is done
slow
fast

=====================
=== Explanation ===
=====================
- Both promises are started concurrently (in parallel) because they are 
  called before the `await` keyword is used.
- The `fast` promise completes first, but the code waits for the `slow` 
  promise due to `await slow`.
- After `slow` resolves, the result "slow" is logged, then 
  "fast" is logged immediately after because the fast promise had already finished.
